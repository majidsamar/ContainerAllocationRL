this is the top view, is sorted solution and variable queue lenght in training
using top view and stack height and is sorted dimension for state representation and also 2d action space
using MPL nn
the problem in the previous experiments was I saw
good performance for 843 and 80 queue lenght but very
bad performance for 95 containers in the queue.
 so may be by increasing the queue size during training I will get reasonalbe decline in performance
 as the length of the state space increases
